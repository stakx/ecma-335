## I.8.6.1.2 Location signatures

All locations are typed. This means that all locations have a **location signature**, which defines constraints on the location, its usage, and on the usage of the values stored in the location. Any valid type signature is a valid location signature. Hence, a location signature contains a type and can additionally contain the constant constraint. The location signature can also contain **location constraints** that give further restrictions on the uses of the location. The location constraints are:

 * The **init-only constraint** promises (hence, requires) that once the location has been initialized, its contents never change. Namely, the contents are initialized before any access, and after initialization, no value can be stored in the location. The contents are always identical to the initialized value (see ยง[I.8.2.3](i.8.2.3-classes-interfaces-and-objects.md)). This constraint, while logically applicable to any location, shall only be placed on fields (static or instance) of compound types.

 * The **literal constraint** promises that the value of the location is actually a fixed value of a built-in type. The value is specified as part of the constraint. Compilers are required to replace all references to the location with its value, and the VES therefore need not allocate space for the location. This constraint, while logically applicable to any location, shall only be placed on static fields of compound types. Fields that are so marked are not permitted to be referenced from CIL (they shall be in-lined to their constant value at compile time), but are available using reflection and tools that directly deal with the metadata.

> #### CLS Rule 13:
>
> The value of a literal static is specified through the use of field initialization metadata (see [Partition II Metadata](ii.5.9-attributes-and-metadata.md)). A CLS-compliant literal must have a value specified in field initialization metadata that is of exactly the same type as the literal (or of the underlying type, if that literal is an **enum**).
>
> _[Note:_
>
> **CLS (consumer):** Must be able to read field initialization metadata for static literal fields and inline the value specified when referenced. Consumers can assume that the type of the field initialization metadata is exactly the same as the type of the literal field (i.e., a consumer tool need not implement conversions of the values).
>
> **CLS (extender):** Must avoid producing field initialization metadata for static literal fields in which the type of the field initialization metadata does not exactly match the type of the field.
>
> **CLS (framework):** Should avoid the use of syntax specifying a value of a literal that requires conversion of the value. Note that compilers can do the conversion themselves before persisting the field initialization metadata resulting in a CLS-compliant framework, but frameworks are encouraged not to rely on such implicit conversions _end note]_

_[Note:_ It might seem reasonable to provide a volatile constraint on a location that would require that the value stored in the location not be cached between accesses. Instead, CIL includes a `volatile.` prefix to certain instructions to specify that the value neither be cached nor computed using an existing cache. Such a constraint can be encoded using a custom attribute (see ยง[I.9.7](i.9.7-metadata-extensibility.md)), although this standard does not specify such an attribute. _end note]_
