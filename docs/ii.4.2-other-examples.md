## II.4.2 Other examples

This Partition contains integrated examples for most features of the CLI metadata. Many subclauses conclude with an example showing a typical use of some feature. All these examples are written using the ILAsm assembly language. In addition, [Partition VI](#todo-missing-hyperlink) contains a longer example of a program written in the ILAsm assembly language. All examples are, of course, informative only.
