## III.1.9 Metadata tokens

Many CIL instructions are followed by a "metadata token". This is a 4-byte value, that specifies a row in a metadata table, or a starting byte offset in the User String heap. The most-significant byte of the token specifies the table or heap. For example, a value of 0x02 specifies the _TypeDef_ table; a value of 0x70 specifies the User String heap. The value corresponds to the number assigned to that metadata table (see [Partition II](#todo-missing-hyperlink) for the full list of tables) or to 0x70 for the User String heap. The least-significant 3 bytes specify the target row within that metadata table, or starting byte offset within the User String heap. The rows within metadata tables are numbered one upwards, whilst offsets in the heap are numbered zero upwards. (So, for example, the metadata token with value 0x02000007 specifies row number 7 in the _TypeDef_ table)
